Our Shop do, however, have to have certain guidelines relating to the return of products. Due to the complexity of computer repairs, faults are often misdiagnosed, meaning parts are either ordered in error or are returned to us as defect when the purchased component is fully functional but the fault on the computer is being caused by a different part. We recognise that computer repair can be a process of elimination and are therefore happy for products ordered in error to be returned.<br>
